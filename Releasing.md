# Making a release

The `bundle` directory contains the production version of the project's Javascript. This is what the WordPress apps use to avoid having to build Gutenberg.

You can rebuild those files at any time by running

```
npm run bundle
```

This is useful in case you want to use an unreleased version of the bundle in the apps. For instance, on a PR that's a work in progress, you might want to include to a specific gutenberg-mobile branch in the apps with an updated bundle so reviewers can see the latest changes before approving them (and releasing a new version).

# Release Checklist Template

When you are ready to cut a new release, use the following template.

For the post title, use this (replacing `X.XX.X` with the applicable release number):

```
Gutenberg Mobile X.XX.X – Release Scenario
```

For the body of the post, just copy this checklist and again replace all occurrences of `X.XX.X` with the applicable release number.

<p>o Visit all opened PR's in gutenberg-mobile repo that are assigned to milestone X.XX.X and leave a message with options to (i) merge the PR as soon as possible, (ii) bump the PR to the next milestone, or (iii) remove the milestone from the PR.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>o Verify that <code>gutenberg-mobile/RNTAztecView.podspec</code> and <code>gutenberg-mobile/gutenberg/packages/react-native-aztec/RNTAztecView.podspec</code> refer to the same <code>WordPress-Aztec-iOS</code> version and are pointing to a stable, tagged release (e.g. 1.14.1).

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>o Verify the WPAndroid PR build succeeds. If PR CI tasks include a 403 error related to an inability to resolve the <code>react-native-bridge</code> dependency, you must wait for the <code>Build Android RN Bridge &amp; Publish to S3</code> task to succeed in gutenberg-mobile and then restart the WPAndroid CI tasks.</p>

Check that we're not adding extra strings from non-native files and that we're not removing strings that are referenced in the code (more info can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/gutenberg-mobile/issues/3466">issue</a>). <strong>If any issue is found, it will require manually modifying the files and push them to the release branch.</strong></p>

# Different types of releases

## Best practices

It's best practice to use the automation script (mentioned in the release template above) for all releases types (regular, betafix, hotfix). When wrangling a betafix or hotfix, it's important to merge the fix to Gutenberg `trunk` independently of the release process. When the release is cut (by the automation script) the commit(s) that make up the betafix or hotfix should then be cherry-picked onto the Gutenberg release branch.

## 1. Regular

### When

On Mondays, one week before main apps (WPiOS & WPAndroid) have cut their releases, every 2 weeks.

### Branches

For example when releasing gutenberg-mobile `1.11.0`.

| Repo             | Cut From | Branch Name                        | Merging To      |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| gutenberg        | trunk    | rnmobile/release_1.11.0            | trunk           |
| gutenberg-mobile | develop  | release/1.11.0                     | trunk & develop |
| WPAndroid        | develop  | gutenberg/integrate_release_1.11.0 | develop         |
| WPiOS            | develop  | gutenberg/integrate_release_1.11.0 | develop         |

## 2. Betafix

### When

A fix is targeting a main app version that is not yet released (meaning the release branch is cut but it's still in beta) and a new gutenberg-mobile release is needed.

### Branches

For example when releasing gutenberg-mobile `1.11.1` while main apps version `22.2.0` is in beta which currently has gutenberg-mobile `1.11.0` in it.
At the same time there could also be a regular release going on for example for gutenberg-mobile version `1.12.0`.

| Repo             | Cut From                | Branch Name                        | Merging To                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| gutenberg        | rnmobile/release_1.11.0 | rnmobile/release_1.11.1            | trunk & (maybe also) rnmobile/release_1.12.0                     |
| gutenberg-mobile | release/1.11.0          | release/1.11.1                     | trunk & develop & (maybe also) release/1.12.0                    |
| WPAndroid        | release/22.2.0          | gutenberg/integrate_release_1.11.1 | release/22.2.0 & (maybe also) gutenberg/integrate_release_1.12.0 |
| WPiOS            | release/22.2.0          | gutenberg/integrate_release_1.11.1 | release/22.2.0 & (maybe also) gutenberg/integrate_release_1.12.0 |

### Automation script differences

1. Before running the script switch to the relevant branch to cut from in gutenberg-mobile repo.
1. Run [release_automation.sh](./release_automation.sh) as usual.
1. When asked by the script enter the relevant branch names to cut from (to target) in other repos.
1. If a commit that is fixing the issue is already merged to gutenberg, when asked by the script enter the commit hash to be cherry-picked.

### Release checklist template differences

1. Include `Betafix` in the heading.
1. `after_X.XX.X` branches can be ignored.

## 3. Hotfix

### When

A fix is targeting a main app version that is already released and a new gutenberg-mobile release is needed.

### Branches

For example when releasing gutenberg-mobile `1.11.1` while main apps version `22.2.0` is released which currently has gutenberg-mobile `1.11.0` in it.
At the same time there could also be a regular release, a betafix or even another hotfix going on for example for gutenberg-mobile version `1.12.1`.

| Repo             | Cut From                | Branch Name                        | Merging To                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| gutenberg        | rnmobile/release_1.11.0 | rnmobile/release_1.11.1            | trunk & (maybe also) rnmobile/release_1.12.1                     |
| gutenberg-mobile | release/1.11.0          | release/1.11.1                     | trunk & develop & (maybe also) release/1.12.1                    |
| WPAndroid        | release/22.2.0          | gutenberg/integrate_release_1.11.1 | release/22.2.1 & (maybe also) gutenberg/integrate_release_1.12.1 |
| WPiOS            | release/22.2.0          | gutenberg/integrate_release_1.11.1 | release/22.2.1 & (maybe also) gutenberg/integrate_release_1.12.1 |

### Automation script differences

1. If necessary create new patch version branches `release/X.Y.1` in WPiOS and WPAndroid.

Rest should be same the as Betafix

### Release checklist template differences

1. Include `Hotfix` in the heading
1. After the fix is merged and if there is an ongoing regular release, betafix or hotfix then the changes should be brought back to those branches as well.

Rest should be same the as Betafix
