<p>ℹ️ The Aztec package dependencies in <code>gutenberg-mobile/RNTAztecView.podspec</code> and <code>gutenberg-mobile/gutenberg/packages/react-native-aztec/RNTAztecView.podspec</code> are incorrect.
  They either refer to a commit SHA instead of a stable release (e.g. 1.14.1) or refer to <em>different</em> versions completed. The following steps must be completed before continuing with the release:</p>
